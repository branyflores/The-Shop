 ## My Testimonial:

 I created this e-commerce to put myself in the shoes of a real life front end developer. It was very exciting for me to work on a website for 7 days. I started it all from scratch, got myself involved in the Back End using an API, and the Front End, creating the styling and all functionalities, to have an online shop working in the real world.

 ## Next Step:

 For the following steps i will be working in making a landing page for the website, also going ahead with the payments details and delivery tools pages. 
 I took the precaution of not deploying a full payment functionalitie for the sefety of all users, but in another hand  you can check the code for [PaymentForm] (https://github.com/branyflores/The-shop/blob/main/src/components/CheckoutForm/PaymentForm.js)
