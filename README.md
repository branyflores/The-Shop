# Ecommerce React Project 


The Shop is my final project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course.
I`ve challenge myself of using react and only javaScript to style the entire project.


## Features

1. Select items
   
2. Add Items into your shopping cart

## Project Planning
Initally, I envisioned the project to be a full e-commerce website. However, As it progressed, it became more obviosu there would take much more than 10 days to finish the entire projrect. 
I have then created a e-commerce (for study purpose ONLY), that will give me the chance to work on it and look for more fetures to implement, such as check out and payment process.

## Api


I am using the free version of the API commerce.js @chec, which makes the website q little slow. 
In time i find that will be necessary to find a better API, so i can have more products and add caterodies to my website.
